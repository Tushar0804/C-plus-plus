UNIT 3    INHERITANCE

Task 01:  Inheritance Basics
          WAP in C++ to create a Parent and Child interaction using inheritance.
          Version 01:   Call the Parent class data members in Child class function without creating object of Parent class.
          Version 02:   Call the Parent class data members in main method by child class object.
          
Task 02:  Multiple Inheritance
          Create two classes named Mammals and MarineAnimals. Create another class named BlueWhale which inherits both the above classes.
          Now, create a function in each of these classes which prints "I am a Mammal", "I am Marine Animal", 
          and "I belong to both the categories: Mammals as well as Marine Animals" respectively.
          Now create an object for each of the above classes and try calling:
          1.   Function of Mammals by the object of Mammals
          2.   Function of MarineAnimals by the object of MarineAnimals
          3.   Function of BlueWhale by the object of BlueWhale
          4.   Function of each of its parent by the object of BlueWhale

Task 03:  Diamond Problem due to Multiple Inheritance
          Version 01:   WAP to illustrate Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance
          Version 02:   Its solution using virtual base classes.

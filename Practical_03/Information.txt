Task 01:    Used " #include<iostream.h> " library.
            On preprocessing this file we faced a fatal error since this library is invalid and not available for the compiler.
 
Task 02:    Here we have not included the " #include<iostream> " library.
            On preprocessing this file we have not faced any error and the file preprocessed successfully.
  
Conclusion of Task 01 & Task 02:  Preprocessor unit check whether the included library's code is avaialble with the compiler or not.
                                  If available it insert all in the code and finishes executing.
  
  
Task 03:    Code written for taking a string as input but cin function only took the first character and after that data has been lost.  

Task 04:    To overcome above issues, we tried to solve the problem by using getline() function which takes whole line as input.

Polymorphism

Task 01:  To overload add method for two parameters with int and float data types in Base class.
          Along with it create a Derived class from the Base class named as child.
          class child should override one of the overloaded method from base class.
          Perform following tasks:
          1.  Try calling overriding method from child class object.
          2.  Write name of the method which is not seen by the child class object
          
          Create two versions:
          version 01:  without 'using' keyword
          version 02:  with 'using' keyword

Task 02:  Base class having a virtual and a pure virtual function.
          Derived class having same copy of virtual function with changed logic and defination of pure virtual function.
          Perform following tasks:
          1.  Try to call child class overriding method from base class pointer.
          2.  Try to call child class defination of pure virtual function in child class.
          3.  Find out the abstraction in above implementation.

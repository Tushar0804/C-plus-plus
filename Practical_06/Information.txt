Task 01:  + operator overloaded { (int + int), (float + float), (int + float), (string + string) }
          When used with string and int, an error occured stating " no match for operator+ ".
          + Operator for string is used to concatenate strings only and will not work with other datatypes.

Task 02:  Input a string and checked whether the given string is palindrome or not.
          Used reverse_iterator to reverse the string.

Task 03:  Input a string and find the reverse of the string.
          1. Using Built-in function reverse().
          2. Using reverse_iterator and then traversing through the string.

Task 04:  Input two strings and then compare for equality by traversing through the string.

Task 05:  Input two strings and then Check the possible values string.compare() function will return with different inputs.

Task 06:  Check whether strings are mutable or immutable in c++.
          Since strings in c++ are by default stored as a character array and hence data can be changed at a particular index.
          This shows that strings are mutable in c++.

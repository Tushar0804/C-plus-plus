Task 01:    Used two namespace first & second in the program each have a function with same name.
            Then we called those function with the help of scope resolution operator.

Task 02:    Used 'using' keyword for namespaces rather than SRO.
            On execution, compiler found ambiguity in the program and produces an error.

Task 03:    When we not used the namespace, the function ran Out Of Scope.
